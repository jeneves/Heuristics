Questions:

1)

2) There are 2^20 unique variable assignments for this problem.

3) We iterate over all possible values of k from 0 through 19. For each value
of k, we run Tabu seach many times with different initial solutions, but with
the same number of maximum iterations. We determine the best k by observing the
average number of cost function evaluations required to find a satisfying
solution.

4)
