Questions:

1)

2) There are 2^20 unique variable assignments for this problem.

3) We iterate over all possible values of k from 0 through 19. For each value
of k, we run Tabu seach many times with different initial solutions, but with
the same number of maximum iterations. We determine the best k by observing the
average number of cost function evaluations required to find a satisfying
solution. The best value for k, according to our results, is 15.

4) We found one satisfying solution in exactly one trial, with k = 15. This
trial had an average of 823 cost function evaluations. The average trial has
approximately 900 cost function evaluations, with an average best aspiration
level of 87.
