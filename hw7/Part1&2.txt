Part 1:
Simulated annealing performs best on average. Greedy search performs second
best, but with a lower variance. The genetic algorithm perfoms worst, with a
very high variance. There was one outlier in the genetic algorithm, with a
value of 488.83. The best algorithm is simulated annealing, with the lowest
average objective value and a reasonable variance.

Part 2:
The simulated annealing algorithm performs best, and stochastically dominates
both greedy search and the genetic algorithm.
