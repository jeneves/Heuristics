Part 1 questions:

c) Since the probability of a certain member being selected as a parent is
directly proportional to it's fitness, it is impossible to assign a probability
to a member with negative fitness. This can be corrected by finding the
individual with the most negative fitness, if one exists, and adding the
absolute value of this fitness to the fitness of every individual. This
will guarantee every individual has a non-negative fitness.

d) The crossover function treats the decision variables as one 14-bit string,
with only one crossover point. Since the decision variables are actually two
distinct integers, we should treat each as a 7-bit string and perform crossover
indepedently for each decision variable.

e) Each decision variable ranges from 0 to 127, inclusive. Therefore there are
128 * 128 = 16386 unique combinations for the pair of decision variable. We can
be certain we've found the optimal solution if we evaluate the objective
function for each of the 16386 decision variable combinations.
