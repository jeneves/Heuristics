The constraint handling techinique proposed by Deb (2000) reduces performance
of the genetic algorithm. The bump function returns f_min - error if the
solution is infeasible. This value may be positive, if the error is small and
the current worst fitness is still large. Thus, an infeasible solution may be
(incorrectly) assigned a positive fitness value.
