The problem of channel allocation for cellular networks is very difficult to solve due to the sheer size of the solution space. Conventional optimization methods cannot be applied to such a problem due to limitations on execution time. Thus, we apply heuristic approaches to search for as a good of a solution as possible within the given time constraints. We have tested several heuristic algorithms including Random Sampling, Simulated Annealing, Greedy Search, Tabu Search, and Dynamically Dimensioned Search. We have also evaluated and compared the results produced by these algorithms, as well as the results produced by our own novel proprietary algorithm: The Sperling Method(TM)[1]. From our analyses, Simulated Annealing outperformed all the other traditional heuristic algorithms. However, The Sperling Method(TM)[1] produced even better results than Simulated Annealing, and is vastly less complex than any of the other algorithms. Thus, from a practical standpoint, the problem of channel allocation for cellular networks is most effectively solved using basic human intuition, with minimal assistance from conventional heuristic search algorithms.
