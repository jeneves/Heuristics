Dynamically dimensioned search was left relatively unchanged from the original implementation provided for homework 8. A neighbor of the current solution is computed by selecting a subvector of each cell (row vector) to shuffle, where the size of the subvector follows a gaussian distribution with standard deviation sigma. This subvector would be selected from a random location anywhere within the cell. Effectively, each cell is treated as a separate dimension for DDS to search. After each iteration, the probability of changing each dimension decreases exponentially.
