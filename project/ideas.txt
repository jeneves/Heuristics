Danny will write cost function.

Split up other 4 algorithms, one person.

(a) Simulated annealing + some interesting change
(b) Binary Genetic Algorithm + some change to crossover - Danny
(c) Tabu Search + DDS - Kevin
(d) Random Sampling + some interesting change

This gives 4 changes where only 1 is needed to have more material to write about.
